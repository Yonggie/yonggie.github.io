excerpt: 'In discovering regularities in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), several machine learning methods, like topic model, auto-encoder, and GNNs, have been proposed for discovering regularities in TCM. However, they are often limited by speciﬁc data challenges (e.g., complex relations with rich TCM knowledge, sparsity and ambiguity, expensive data labeling, etc.) in TCM formulae. Addressing these challenges, we ﬁrst establish a TCM Attributed Heterogeneous Information Network (TAHIN) for modeling massive formulae, which can assemble various types of additional information and capture their relations. We further propose a novel hybrid-scales graph contrastive learning framework to learn high-quality node representations in a whole unsupervised manner which can be helpful for various tasks of discovering regularities such as herb classiﬁcation and herb similarity search, etc. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our method. Our source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Yonggie/HsCTRD.'
